            Every time there’s a crisis or a major problem, there are opportunities
            that lead to improvements. For example, there will be more people with 
           ideas about how to distribute things — leading to more Amazon-like 
           companies. There will be innovations in rapid diagnostics; the Holy 
           Grail is a home test for COVID-19. There will be new platforms — I don’t
            think Zoom is the end; there will be competitors. These will all 
           produce jobs. We’re also learning more about education, so you’ll see 
           more companies emerging around home schooling and education.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 26px;">Much
            of the economy will come back in information technology and 
           manufacturing — and then in the service industry, because you’ll need to
            service all of these things. I actually think COVID will lead to more 
           economic development once we control it
