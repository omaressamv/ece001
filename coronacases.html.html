    <h2>How COVID-19 Spreads
    </h2>
    <p>
    
    COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus.</br>
     These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth.</br>
     In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. </br>
     People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.
    
    COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:
    <ul>
    <li>Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.
    </li>
    
    <li>Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.
    </li>
    <li>Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.
    </li>
